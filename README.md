# Samsung-Prism-5G-Research
This repository supports a collaborative research initiative under the Samsung PRISM program, focusing on the intersection of 5G/6G security, Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC), and AI-driven analytics using NWDAF (Network Data Analytics Function).
üîç Project Objective:

To design and prototype an AI-based framework for real-time, secure call authentication and fraud prevention in next-generation networks. The system leverages:

    Post-Quantum Cryptographic techniques for future-resilient authentication

    NWDAF to extract actionable network insights and detect anomalies

    AI/ML models to identify and mitigate fraudulent activity in-call signaling and behavior patterns

üì° Focus Areas:

    5G/6G Network Security Enhancements

    Integration of PQC in Call Authentication Protocols

    AI-Based Fraud Detection

    Real-Time Data Analysis via NWDAF

üë• Team:

A collaborative effort by students and mentors under the Samsung PRISM program.
